# Procedural-Content-Generation

The aim of this project is to procedurally generate a scene within the unity game engine.

Pirates Cove, the name chosen for the developed game, was designed to be as simple as possible, yet very effective in the ways that it generates different objects each time.

With the project being largely inspired by world of warcrafts battle for azeroth expansion, vegetation, ships, homes, birds, fish and magical towers, were chosen to be generated.

A video can be seen below:

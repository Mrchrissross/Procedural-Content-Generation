## What is the Scriptable Render Pipeline (SRP)

The SRP is a new Unity feature that has been designed to give artists and developers full control over the Unity rendering pipeline, giving them the tools they need to create modern, high-fidelity graphics in Unity. 
SRP allows developers to write C# scripts to control the way Unity renders each frame. By exposing the Unity rendering pipeline to C#, Unity becomes less of a “black box” as developers can see and control exactly what happens during the rendering process. 

Developers can use the two built-in pipelines that are provided as part of SRP (the Lightweight Pipeline and the High-Definition Rendering Pipeline(HDRP)), they can develop their own pipelines from scratch or they can modify the provided pipelines to adapt them to their own requirements.

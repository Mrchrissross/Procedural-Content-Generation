- New Sub Graph assets now default to the "Sub Graphs" path in the Create Node menu.
- New Shader Graph assets now default to the "Shader Graphs" path in the Shader menu.

- `Channel Mask` node controls are now aligned correctly.
- In Lightweight Render Pipeline, Pre-multiply surface type now matches the Lit shader. 

## [4.0.0-preview] - 2018-09-28
### Added
- Shader Graph now supports the High Definition Render Pipeline with both PBR and Unlit Master nodes. Shaders built with Shader Graph work with both the Lightweight and HD render pipelines.
- You can now modify vertex position via the Position slot on the PBR and Unlit Master nodes. By default, the input to this node is object space position. Custom inputs to this slot should specify the absolute local position of a given vertex. Certain nodes (such as Procedural Shapes) are not viable in the vertex shader. Such nodes are incompatible with this slot.
- You can now edit the Reference name for a property. To do so, select the property and type a new name next to Reference. If you want to reset to the default name, right-click Reference, and select Reset reference.
- In the expanded property window, you can now toggle whether the property is exposed.
- You can now change the path of Shader Graphs and Sub Graphs. When you change the path of a Shader Graph, this modifies the location it has in the shader selection list. When you change the path of Sub Graph, it will have a different location in the node creation menu.
- Added `Is Front Face` node. With this node, you can change graph output depending on the face sign of a given fragment. If the current fragment is part of a front face, the node returns true. For a back face, the node returns false. Note: This functionality requires that you have enabled **two sided** on the Master node.
- Gradient functionality is now available via two new nodes: Sample Gradient and Gradient Asset. The Sample Gradient node samples a gradient given a Time parameter. You can define this gradient on the Gradient slot control view. The Gradient Asset node defines a gradient that can be sampled by multiple Sample Gradient nodes using different Time parameters.
- Math nodes now have a Waves category. The category has four different nodes: Triangle wave, Sawtooth wave, Square wave, and Noise Sine wave. The Triangle, Sawtooth, and Square wave nodes output a waveform with a range of -1 to 1 over a period of 1. The Noise Sine wave outputs a standard Sine wave with a range of -1 to 1 over a period of 2 * pi. For variance, random noise is added to the amplitude of the Sine wave, within a determined range.
- Added `Sphere Mask` node for which you can indicate the starting coordinate and center point. The sphere mask uses these with the **Radius** and **Hardness** parameters. Sphere mask functionality works in both 2D and 3D spaces, and is based on the vector coordinates in the **Coords and Center** input.
- Added support for Texture 3D and Texture 2D Array via two new property types and four new nodes.
- A new node `Texture 2D LOD` has been added for LOD functionality on a Texture 2D Sample. Sample Texture 2D LOD uses the exact same input and output slots as Sample Texture 2D, but also includes an input for level of detail adjustments via a Vector1 slot.
- Added `Texel Size` node, which allows you to get the special texture properties of a Texture 2D Asset via the `{texturename}_TexelSize` variable. Based on input from the Texture 2D Asset, the node outputs the width and height of the texel size in Vector1 format.
- Added `Rotate About Axis` node. This allows you to rotate a 3D vector space around an axis. For the rotation, you can specify an amount of degrees or a radian value.
- Unpacking normal maps in object space.
- Unpacking derivative maps option on sample texture nodes.
- Added Uint type for instancing support.
- Added HDR option for color material slots.
- Added definitions used by new HD Lit Master node.
- Added a popup control for a string list.
- Added conversion type (position/direction) to TransformNode.
- In your preview for nodes that are not master nodes, pixels now display as pink if they are not finite.

### Changed
- The settings for master nodes now live in a small window that you can toggle on and off. Here, you can change various rendering settings for your shader.
- There are two Normal Derive Nodes: `Normal From Height` and `Normal Reconstruct Z`.
  `Normal From Height` uses Vector1 input to derive a normal map.
  `Normal Reconstruct Z` uses the X and Y components in Vector2 input to derive the proper Z value for a normal map.
- The Texture type default input now accepts render textures.
- HD PBR subshader no longer duplicates surface description code into vertex shader.
- If the current render pipeline is not compatible, master nodes now display an error badge.
- The preview shader now only considers the current render pipeline. Because of this there is less code to compile, so the preview shader compiles faster.
- When you rename a shader graph or sub shader graph locally on your disk, the title of the Shader Graph window, black board, and preview also updates.
- Removed legacy matrices from Transfomation Matrix node.
- Texture 2D Array and Texture 3D nodes can no longer be used in the vertex shader.
- `Normal Create` node has been renamed to `Normal From Texture`.
- When you close the Shader Graph after you have modified a file, the prompt about saving your changes now shows the file name as well.
- `Blend` node now supports Overwrite mode.
- `Simple Noise` node no longer has a loop.
- The `Polygon` node now calculates radius based on apothem.
- `Normal Strength` node now calculates Z value more accurately.
- You can now connect Sub Graphs to vertex shader slots. If a node in the Sub Graph specifies a shader stage, that specific Sub Graph node is locked to that stage. When an instance of a Sub Graph node is connected to a slot that specifies a shader stage, all slots on that instance are locked to the stage.
- Separated material options and tags.
- Master node settings are now recreated when a topological modification occurs.

### Fixed
- Vector 1 nodes now evaluate correctly. ([#334](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ShaderGraph/issues/334) and [#337](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ShaderGraph/issues/337))
- Properties can now be copied and pasted.
- Pasting a property node into another graph will now convert it to a concrete node. ([#300](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ShaderGraph/issues/300) and [#307](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ShaderGraph/pull/307))
- Nodes that are copied from one graph to another now spawn in the center of the current view. ([#333](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ShaderGraph/issues/333))
- When you edit sub graph paths, the search window no longer yields a null reference exception.
- The blackboard is now within view when deserialized.
- Your system locale can no longer cause incorrect commands due to full stops being converted to commas.
- Deserialization of subgraphs now works correctly.
- Sub graphs are now suffixed with (sub), so you can tell them apart from other nodes.
- Boolean and Texture type properties now function correctly in sub-graphs.
- The preview of a node does not obstruct the selection outliner anymore.
- The Dielectric Specular node no longer resets its control values.
- You can now copy, paste, and duplicate sub-graph nodes with vector type input ports.
- The Lightweight PBR subshader now normalizes normal, tangent, and view direction correctly.
- Shader graphs using alpha clip now generate correct depth and shadow passes.
- `Normal Create` node has been renamed to `Normal From Texture`.

- `Show Generated Code` no longer throws an "Argument cannot be null" error.
- Sub Graphs now use the correct generation mode when they generate preview shaders.
- The `CodeFunctionNode` API now generates correct function headers when you use `DynamicMatrix` type slots.

- Shader Graphs no longer display an error message intended for Sub Graphs when you delete properties.
- The Shader Graph and Sub Shader Graph file extensions are no longer case-sensitive.
- The dynamic value slot type now uses the correct decimal separator during HLSL generation.
- Fixed an issue where Show Generated Code could fail when external editor was not set.

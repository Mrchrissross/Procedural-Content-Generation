# Scripting API

## Description

This section of the documentation contains details of the scripting API that Shader Graph provides. To use this information, you should be familiar with the basic theory and practice of scripting in Unity which is explained in the [Scripting](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ScriptingSection.html) section of our manual.

The scripting reference is organised according to the classes available to scripts which are described along with their methods, properties and any other information relevant to their use.
